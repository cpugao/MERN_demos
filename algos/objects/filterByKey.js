/* 
  Given an array of objects, a searchFor string, and searchBy key that exists in the object
  return a new array of only those objects whose value for the given key starts with the given search string

  You can assume the key will exist on the object and the value of that key will be a string

  Bonus: make the search case insensitive
  Bonus: re-write it with functional programming in mind, using built in methods
  Bonus: allow the search method to be provided as a parameter, e.g., string methods: includes, startsWith, endsWith
    - you can assume the searchMethod will be valid
